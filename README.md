# LMKD PSI Activator
Magisk module to fix RAM management by activating psi mode in LMKD which is more efficient, faster and more stable than traditional minfree_levels most ROMs used

## TODO

- [ ] Install amazing module [NoSwipeToKill](https://github.com/dantmnf/NoSwipeToKill) by [dantmnf](https://github.com/dantmnf) to really make this module working as expected in MIUI, ending the pain of RAM management bullshit in MIUI, no more VPN killed, the truth is i'm trying to do something similiar but completely missed the point.
- [ ] Adressing ghost touch issue and navigation gesture not working on MIUI because you can't touch the edge of the screen, maybe because the LMKD is modded by xiaomi
